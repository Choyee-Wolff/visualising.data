									<h3>Report</h3>
									<p>This week, I had a one-on-one session with my professor to discuss my report. During the meeting, I received feedback that my report was focused too much on code explaination. I felt so lucky that I have known that, I still have time to change even though I had put a lot of effort into this detailed report. I also felt overwhelmed by the task of cutting down the content because I believed that most of it was relevant. 
										The positive aspect of this experience was that it provided me with valuable insights into professional writing and expectations in a business context. The professor's feedback gave me a clearer understanding of how to tailor my communication to suit a specific audience. On the negative side, it was challenging to reduce the word count without feeling like I was losing important information. 
										</p>
									<p>The feedback I received made me realise that I needed to prioritise clarity and brevity to make the report more useful for its intended audience. The challenge of cutting down the content pushed me to refine my editing skills and focus on delivering value with fewer words. I learned that adapting my writing style to different contexts is crucial for effective communication. 
										Moving forward, I will seek feedback earlier in the writing process to ensure I am on the right track before completing the full draft. Additionally, I will make a habit of reviewing my work with a critical eye, asking myself whether each section adds value to the report.
