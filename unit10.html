									<h3>Dashboard Draft</h3>
									<p>This week, I worked on creating a dashboard using Tableau for the first time. Initially, I found that Tableau didn’t function as I expected, which led to my dashboard looking quite different from the original draft. I found this change amusing because it showed how flexible I needed to be in my approach. I also faced a significant challenge when I wanted to include a forecast chart but realised that I didn’t have the necessary data. I spent three days searching for the right data and eventually solved the issue by using an Index price, which made me feel very proud of my persistence. At the same time, I felt frustrated because of the time I had spent on this, as I initially thought it would be a straightforward task. However, I believe that incorporating the time series data made my final visualisation more valuable. </p>
									<p>The positive aspect of this experience was the growth in my skills and confidence. Learning how to adapt and solve problems on the fly was valuable, and I now have a better understanding of how Tableau works and the importance of the right data for forecasting. The downside was the significant amount of time I spent searching for data, which felt inefficient and somewhat discouraging. Nevertheless, this time investment ultimately improved the quality of my dashboard, as the inclusion of time series data made it more insightful. The differences between my initial draft and the final dashboard showed me that I need to be open to changes and willing to adjust my approach based on the capabilities of the software. In the future, I will try to balance persistence with efficiency, knowing when to keep searching for solutions and when to seek alternative approaches. </p>
