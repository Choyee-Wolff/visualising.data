									<h3>Left &amp; Right</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Logistic.png" alt="" /></span>This week, I tried to code R for statistical models but I struggled because I found it difficult to understand the fundamental of each statistical models. The textbook I was using was too complicated, and I couldn’t grasp the concepts. I ended up turning to YouTube,  Statsquest channel, which helped break down statistical concepts in a simpler way.
										I felt overwhelmed and frustrated at the beginning because I couldn’t understand the statistical models, which made learning R even more challenging. It was discouraging to feel like I was stuck, especially when the book wasn’t making sense. However, discovering resources like Statsquest gave me some relief and motivation because the content was much easier to understand. I also have done the first bit of my assignment. 
										</p>
									<p>A positive aspect of this experience I found that start from basic concept and slowly move up to R code was easier for me. On the downside, I felt like I wasted time initially struggling with fixing the code, which slowed down my progress. But it is fine and it is past of learning process.
										The challenge arose because I was trying to learn two new skills simultaneously: programming in R and understanding statistical models. Going forward, I will continue to use video resources like YouTube and other resources to help solidify my understanding of statistical models and R. I will also try to find beginner-friendly textbooks or online courses that focus on the basics before diving into more advanced content.
