									<h3>Last lecture</h3>
									<p>This was my last week of lectures, and I felt like time flew by. I attended all my classes and actively participated by sharing my work. Today, I presented my dashboard and received feedback that I should consider using multiple pages for better organisation instead of having everything on a single page. I also shared comments on my peersâ€™ dashboards, offering constructive feedback. I felt a mix of emotions this week because it was the last week of lectures, but also pride for having attended all the classes and actively participated. </p>
									<p>A positive aspect of this experience was the opportunity to engage with my peers and contribute to their learning by sharing my insights. This helped me feel more confident and valued in the learning process. On the downside, the feedback about restructuring my dashboard showed me that I still have areas to improve in terms of layout design and user experience. Nevertheless, it was a constructive suggestion that will make my work stronger. Sharing feedback with peers not only helped them but also allowed me to develop better communication skills and become more confident in expressing my ideas. Moving forward, I will apply the feedback I received by restructuring my dashboard to use multiple pages for better organisation. I will also continue to actively participate in discussions and offer feedback to my peers, as it helps me improve my communication skills. </p>
