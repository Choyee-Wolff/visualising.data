									<h3>Report</h3>
									<p>I applied hierarchical clustering methods to my dataset in R, aiming to identify meaningful clusters for the report. However, the results did not provide valuable insights due to the nature of the data. The clusters formed were not clearly defined or useful for drawing conclusions. I became frustrated and felt like I had wasted time applying these techniques without adding value to the report. Despite this, I acknowledged that I gained some new skills in R and learned about clustering methods, which was still a positive takeaway. Time constraints also prevented me from exploring other clustering methods that might have yielded better results, such as DBSCAN or Gaussian Mixture Models.
										</p>
									<p>The challenge arose from the dataset not being suitable for the clustering techniques I applied. The data may have lacked clear groupings or contained too much noise, which made it difficult to form meaningful clusters. Additionally, my limited experience with clustering methods restricted my ability to troubleshoot or try alternative approaches. From this experience, I learned that itâ€™s crucial to evaluate the data's suitability for clustering before applying these techniques. While learning K-means and hierarchical clustering was valuable, I should have spent more time assessing whether these methods were appropriate for the data. In the future, I will be more mindful of the limitations of different clustering approaches and consider alternative methods when faced with similar challenges.</p>
