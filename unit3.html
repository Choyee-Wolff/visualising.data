									<h3>Ethical Writing</h3>
									<p>I posted a report comparing the Ryanair and EasyJet websites in a discussion forum. However, after reviewing my peers' posts, I realised I had forgotten to include references, which are crucial for academic work. This is a core aspect of ethical writing.
										Firstly, I felt embarrassed and disappointed with myself for forgetting such a fundamental component. Seeing my peersâ€™ posts made me anxious about how my own work would be seen. However, this situation also inspired me to improve and avoid making the same mistake in the future. On a bright side, this is just in a discussion group not an academic report for the assignment. 
										</p>
									
										<p>This only happened because I was more focused on the content and analysis than on following academic writing conventions. If I had made it a habit to note down my sources while researching, I could have easily included them in my report
										I learned that no matter how well a report is written, failing to include references undermines its quality and academic integrity. In future assignments, I will be more diligent about keeping track of my sources and will make sure to incorporate citations during the writing process, rather than as an afterthought.
										To prevent this from happening again, I will create a checklist that includes references as a key component to review before submission. I will also set aside time specifically for reviewing the academic conventions in my work, including citations.
