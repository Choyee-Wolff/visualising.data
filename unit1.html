									<h3>Vitualisation</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/present.png" alt="" /></span>When I was working as a Data Analyst, my manager often questioned me about the visualisations I presented. The questions were about the colour of the graphs, the types of graphs, and the reasons why I used specific statistical methods. These sessions sometimes felt more like interrogations than discussions, which caused me stress and anxiety before the meetings. A positive aspect of this situation was that I was able to build relationships with my colleagues, as I often asked them to review my presentation beforehand. I also learned to prepare my graphs more thoroughly, understand my audience’s point of view, and make the presentations as simple as possible. A negative aspect of this situation was that it made me doubt my graphs and affected my confidence.</p>
									<p>My manager’s questions were simply to ensure that my data was accurate, clear, and that he fully understood what I was trying to convey, so he could make informed decisions based on my presentation. At times, my presentation wasn’t very smooth and could cause confusion about the points I was trying to communicate. My manager also preferred the graphs to be presented in the same format each month, so he could easily understand them at a glance.

I now understand how important visualisation is. I can prepare the graphs to be both simple and insightful, using straightforward terms and being ready to explain them clearly.</p>
