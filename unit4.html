									<h3>Left &amp; Right</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/VSC.png" alt="" /></span>I recently downloaded Visual Studio Code and began learning about creating an e-portfolio. This was my first experience building a website or e-portfolio I struggled with understanding how to structure the e-portfolio effectively. To seek guidance, I reached out to my professor, who provided helpful feedback. After receiving the advice, I updated the content and took time to choose a style for the e-portfolio that would create an appealing and professional page. I plan to present my e-portfolio in the upcoming lecture.</p>
									<p>I felt uneasy and uncertain because web development was new to me, and I lacked experience in creating an e-portfolio. The process seemed overwhelming. However, reaching out to my professor for help was reassuring. I felt more confident and motivated after receiving his feedback, as it clarified what I needed to focus on. I felt a sense of accomplishment when I started seeing my progress in updating the e-portfolio.
										The positive aspect of this experience was that I learned the basics of using Visual Studio Code and began understanding how to create a simple web-based e-portfolio. On the downside, I also spent a lot of time trying to decide on design elements ( I have changed my template for some reason), which delayed progress on the content itself.
