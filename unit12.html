									<h3>Time Management</h3>
									<p>As I approach the submission deadline for my final projects, I’m experiencing a lack of confidence in the quality of my work. I feel like there’s more I could do to improve the projects, but I’m constrained by the time limits. This situation has made me wish for more time to refine the work and address areas where I think I could add value. Despite putting in considerable effort, I’m still uncertain whether the projects fully meet my standards, or the expectations set out in the course. 
										A positive aspect of this experience is that it has pushed me to work efficiently and prioritise the most important elements of my projects. However, the downside is that the time pressure has made it challenging to produce work that I feel is my best. The lack of confidence in my submissions is not a comfortable feeling, and it highlights areas where my time management and project planning could have been better.
										</p>
									<p>This experience has shown me the importance of time management and planning when working on complex projects. While I put in the effort, I might not have allocated enough time for refining and revising my work. The feeling that there was more I could have done points to the need for better pacing, breaking down the tasks earlier in the process, and setting more realistic goals. The time constraint has made me realise that not every project will be perfect, and sometimes it’s necessary to accept good enough when faced with deadlines. This experience has taught me the value of balancing quality with efficiency. Going forward, I will aim to put more time in the projects in each day, allow more time for revisions, and set priorities more clearly to ensure that I can improve the quality of my work without feeling rushed.</p>
