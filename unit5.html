									<h3>Presentation</h3>
									<p>This week, I presented my work for the first time, which was my e-portfolio project. I felt very nervous before the presentation, especially since I had seen my peers present before me, and I felt that their work was better than mine. However, after I showed my work and received feedback from the tutor and peers, I realised that I was on the right track. They also appreciated my work as a good example.
										Initially, I felt anxious and insecure about my presentation. I doubted whether my work was good enough compared to others. During the presentation, however, those feelings started to shift as I noticed the positive reactions from my audience. I felt relieved and proud when I realised that my work was being received well and that it even served as a helpful example for others. This experience boosted my confidence and made me feel more capable of succeeding in future presentations.
										</p>
									<p>The positive aspect of this experience was the constructive feedback and appreciation I received. It reassured me that I was on the right path and capable of meeting the project requirements. The feedback boosted my confidence and knowing that my work was seen as a good example was motivating. On the other hand, the negative aspect was the nervousness and self-doubt I experienced before presenting. 
										The anxiety I felt stemmed from comparing my work to that of my peers and underestimating my own efforts. The presentation helped me realise that my work was not only adequate but also valuable to others. This experience highlighted the importance of focusing on my progress rather than comparing myself to others. The positive feedback I received reassured me that I am capable of producing quality work when I put in the effort. From this experience, I learned that it is important to have confidence in my work.Moving forward, I will focus on learning from their approaches instead of comparing my work to theirs. I will continue to seek feedback and use it as a tool for growth.
